    text: 'Up on its main thoroughfare, Church Street, Stokieâ€™s cafes are mostly depressingly behind the curve: all huge frothing cappuccinos and heavy bought-in cakes. So all hail the lovely Esters, on a quiet side street, for its slick contemporary interior and impeccable modern coffee. Owners Nia Burr and Jack Lloyd-Jones met working at Fernandez & Wells before taking over the reins at this tucked-away little gem. Go for its imaginative ever-changing menu (French toast with fragolina grapes and whipped ricotta, for example) and its magnificent cakes.',
